Eddie Brett

We are creating a website for the London street poet Eddie Brett. The site wants to be simple, clean and appealing to a 17-28 demographic. He is starting a new project and this website is acting as a transitional piece until more material and information is available. He wants visitors to know who he is, what he has done, what he is doing and how to get in touch. The website should appear professional without being overly formal. It needs to feel inviting, unique and slightly quirky to compliment Eddie’s personallity and work.

From looking at Eddie’s social media activity and artwork i can see that he likes pastel colours, ‘poppin’s’ font and using lowercase text. With this in mind i've included all three things in the site. I've kept layout elements consistent and uniformed throughout the site in order to give each visitor a sense or calm and ease in order to give them a positive quick experience on the site. I've placed a few subtle punk inspired features e.g. typewriter font hover, inverted negative photograph effect on the social hover icons, i've given text white borders to look like labelling and i've put text both to the left and right to give the user a sense of mystery from the norm. Hopefully these little quirks give personallity to the site and give it a unique feel cosidering how simplistic and uniformed it is. I wanted the music page to splatter across the page like a sporadic collage, i have achieved this to some degree however at the moment it looks fairly regimented and i think i'll spend some more time on this in the future to create a bespoke layout.

The music industry is going through a big resergence of DIY artists and so i didnt want to use anything too fancy or complex and have kept everything matter of fact. Only including information that is neccesary. 

Eventually i'll add an online shop to the site aswell as various blogs/ new release information and touring information.

My design reference points were lifestyle fashions brands such as; adidas and supreme. I also looked at poets, musicians and rappers such as George the poet, Rizzle Kickz, Tyler the creator/ odd future, George Ezra, Mac Demarco and Al the Native to give me a sense of what was happening, what works, what doesn't and how to avoid being a copycat.

I've used bootstrap, HTML5, CSS and google fonts within this project.

I have tested it out of different devices with different size requirements and am confident across the board.
